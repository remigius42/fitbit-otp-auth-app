# Fitbit OTP Auth app documentation

The documentation for the Fitbit OTP Auth app is built via GitHub pages.
However, the [architecture
documentation](https://remigius42.github.io/fitbit-tokens-tmp/architecture/) has
been set up such that it can be read in the [GitHub
repository](docs/architecture/README.md) directly as well.
